# bankinguichallenge
A Flutter implementation of https://dribbble.com/shots/14364583-Online-Banking-Mobile-App, and 6th lab.

## Smh no docs
As long as I understand it, it's fine. Proper documentation takes time, and that is something I don't have.

## HAHA LOL YOUR CODE DOESN"T USE x & x for best practices
I'm not a corporate slave (yet), and have only so much time to complete this lab

## WHY ARE YOU USING BLoC FOR SUCH A SIMPLE APP!!!
Because I want to. Deal with it.

## How is this organized
Every lab should get it's own subfolder, which should be a valid Android Studio Project.

## Give screenshots pls.
I'll add em to the repo whenever I get the time (or feel like it).

## haha will stealio your code
pls no
